Always the caravan of sound made us halt   
to admire the swinging and the swift go-by   
of beasts with enormous hooves and heads   
beating the earth or reared against the sky. 
Do not reread, I mean glance ahead to see 
what has become of the colossal forms: 
everything happened at the instant of passing: 
the hoof-beat, the whinny, the bells on the harness,   
the creak of the wheels, the monkey’s fandango   
in double time over the elephant’s back. 
When the marching was over and we were free to go on   
there was never before us a dungfall or a track 
on the road-sands of any kind: 
only the motion of footprints being made 
crossing and recrossing in the trampled mind.
Past the fourth cloverleaf, by dwindling roads   
At last we came into the unleashed wind; 
The Chesapeake rose to meet us at a dead end   
Beyond the carnival wheels and gingerbread.
